# ThingML-Tron

ThingML-Tron is a multi player game for arduino developped with ThingML. I has been developped for arduinos uno (from 2 to 8) connected through UART. (Code for a gateway targetting an arduino mega is also available.)

Uploadable sources are inthe directory thingml-gen (in C for arduino), but you can regenerate the code with ThingML tools if you wish to alter it.

Here is an example of a 2 players setup:

And here a 4 players setup connected through an arduino mega gateway:

##About ThingML

ThingML is a modeling language for embedded and distributed systems. It is developped by the Networked Systems and Services department of SINTEF in Oslo, Norway.

ThingML stands for "Thing" Modeling Language as a reference to the so called Internet of Things.

The idea of ThingML is to develop a practical model-driven software engineering tool-chain which targets resource constrained embedded systems such as low-power sensor and microcontroller based devices. 

You can find:
